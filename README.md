# Group Calculator Project

This project aims to test our proficiency in implementing various mathematical operations, logic, and data structures such as functions, loops, and arrays, which we have learned during our training.

We will collaborate as a group to create a calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced operations like square root and exponentiation.

By working together on this project, we aim to enhance our problem-solving skills, deepen our understanding of programming concepts, and strengthen our ability to collaborate effectively as a team. Let's build an impressive and functional calculator together!
